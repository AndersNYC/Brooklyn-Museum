# Brooklyn-Museum
Python program that pulls individual names inside database of 200K rows of user chat log data, from the Ask app.

Built as part of a user research and data visualization project, this program is designed to pull names from a database of user chats using the BM Ask App. The Ask app lets users chat with museum staff to learn more about art, artists, and the museum itself.

This program pulls names, which are then counted, to understand which artists the users are chatting about most. This information lets the museum plan how to better serve and educate its visitors by anticipating their hot spots.
